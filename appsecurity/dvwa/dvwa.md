# DVWA - Attacks and Tests 

Next some of the possible attacks on this application (DVWA) will be demonstrated. The possible attacks are the following:
- [Brute-Force](bruteforce.md)
- [Command Injection](commandinjection.md)
- [File inclusion](fileinclusion.md)
- [File upload](fileupload.md)
- [SQL Injection](sqli.md)
- [SQL Injection (Blind)](sqliblind.md)
- [XSS (Reflected)](xssreflected.md)
- [XSS (Stored)](xssstored.md).

In some of these attacks it is necessary to take into account that the web application was developed in PHP, however most of these attacks also work on other development technologies (Java, Ruby, .Net, Perl, among others).
