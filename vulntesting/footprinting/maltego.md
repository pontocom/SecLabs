Add a Website entity to the "**New Graph**" area. Then change the address of the website with something else - the domain you want to research.

Then right-click and "**Run Transforms**", then "**All Transforms**".

There might be some other information that needs filling.

From here, Maltego will start to explore the website you've just selected.

We can also be a little more selective and conduct some more precise investigation. For instance, you may select the IP address and try to find the country and city "**Run Transforms -> To Location [city, country]**".

And so much more information is possible to obtain with Maltego.
