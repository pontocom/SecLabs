# Vulnerability Identification and Analysis

In this part of the lab the objective is to learn how to do vulnerability identification. We have already approached this topic while we were discussing “nmap”, however in here we are going to approach the following tools:

* [OpenVAS](openvas/README.md)
  * [OpenVAS Architecture](openvas/architecture.md)
  * [Installing OpenVAS on Kali Linux](openvas/install.md)
  * [Starting and Stopping OpenVAS](openvas/startstop.md)
  * [Navigating through OpenVAS](openvas/navigation.md)
  * [Scanning a target](openvas/scan.md)
* [Nessus](nessus/README.md)
