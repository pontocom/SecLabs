## Setup

Throughout this lab you will need to use the following material:

- a web browser
- the Kali Linux virtual machine
- some vulnerable virtual machines - in this case, we are going to use the Metasploitable 2 and Windows 7 virtual machines.

## How an attacker acts

An attacker conducts several activities from selecting target/objective until the compromise of such target. One of the frameworks that helps understand what happens during an attack is provided by the [Cyber Kill Chain](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html). This was developed by [Lockheed Martin](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/) and represents a model for identification and prevention of cyber intrusions activity. The model identifies what the adversaries must complete in order to achieve their objective.

The seven steps of the framework enhance visibility into an attack and enrich an analyst’s understanding of an adversary’s tactics, techniques and procedures. The **seven** steps are:

1. **Reconnaissance**:
2. **Weaponization**:
3. **Delivery**:
4. **Exploitation**:
5. **Installation**:
6. **Command & Control**:
7. **Actions on Objective**:
