# Vulnerability Exploitation

Vulnerability exploitation refers to the act of exploiting or taking advantage of a weakness or vulnerability in a computer system, network, or application. The objective of vulnerability exploitation is to gain unauthorized access, steal sensitive information, or cause damage to the system.

Hackers often use vulnerability exploitation to compromise computer systems and steal information. They use various tools specifically designed for this purpose. These tools help hackers identify vulnerabilities in target systems and exploit them for their gain.

It's essential to note that vulnerability exploitation should be done ethically and legally, with the appropriate permissions and authorizations from the system owner. Unauthorized use of these tools can lead to severe legal consequences.

Overall, vulnerability exploitation is a significant threat to cybersecurity, and it's crucial to take measures to prevent it. System owners should regularly update their systems and applications, use strong passwords, and implement security measures such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems.

Vulnerability exploitation can be performed using various tools. Some of the most popular tools for vulnerability exploitation are:

- [Metasploit Framework](https://www.metasploit.com/)
- [Nmap](https://nmap.org/)
- [OWASP Zed Attack Proxy](https://www.zaproxy.org/)
- [Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus)
- [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp)
- [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)

For this lab we will be using Metasploit Framework.

**Important Note**: some of these guides offer information on how to discover and explore vulnerabilities. You should only use this knowledge and tools on systems that you own and/or are authorised to conduct such activities in an ethical manner. Be aware that if you use this knowledge or tools on systems for which you are not authorised, you may be committing cybercrime and could face prosecution.
