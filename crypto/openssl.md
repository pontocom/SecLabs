# Cryptography with OpenSSL/LibreSSL

## INTRODUCTION
This document aims to demonstrate the use of cryptographic mechanisms based on the OpenSSL/LibreSSL library. This library has the ability to work with cryptographic mechanisms such as symmetric cryptography, asymmetric cryptography, generation of message authentication codes as well as work with digital certificates and more.

To run these labs the following requirements are needed:
- OpenSSL/LibreSSL.

The goal of these labs is to demonstrate the use of the OpenSSL library to provide a range of cryptographic functionality.

The examples presented here only demonstrate just a small sample of the full capabilities of OpenSSL.

## SETUP
There is nothing very relevant to do in terms of setup. You just need to install the OpenSSL library - if you use the Kali Linux distribution (or any other Linux distribution, such as Ubuntu, Debian or Parrot OS), it may already be installed by default.

On Windows, OpenSSL can be installed using for example the Cygwin software package. On MacOS, OpenSSL is installed by default, but if you need to use a newer version of it, you can use the Brew  tool (https://brew.sh).

For Windows there are also other options that you can use. So, the main alternatives for installing OpenSSL on Windows 10/11, are as follows (from the simplest to the most complicated):
1. Use Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/) to install OpenSSL on Windows 10 with Powershell, or directly install the OpenSSL binary from the web site;
2. Use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), which allows you to run Linux applications on Windows 10/11 - in practice it is like installing Linux on top of Windows 10/11;
3. Use a Linux distribution, inside a virtualization tool like VMware (https://www.vmware.com/) or VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org/), on top of Windows 10/11;
4. Any other, which may involve the use of containers such as Docker (https://www.docker.com/).

Regarding option 1, it is described in the following links:
- https://adamtheautomator.com/openssl-windows-10/ 
- https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html ; https://medium.com/swlh/installing-openssl-on-windows-10-and-updating-path-80992e26f6a1 

Regarding option 2, it is explained in the following links: 
- https://www.windowscentral.com/install-windows-subsystem-linux-windows-10 
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install 

Regarding option 3, it consists of:
- Download a Linux distribution, such as Ubuntu (https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you?version=20.04.3&architecture=amd64) 
- Download and install either VMware Workstation Player (https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html) or VirtualBox  (https://www.virtualbox.org/) on Windows 10/11. This site even has already prepared Ubuntu images to be installed in both virtualization environments;
- Install the Linux distribution in the selected virtualization environment.

## SYMMETRIC CRYPTOGRAPHY
Here we will demonstrate some of the features of the OpenSSL library for performing symmetric key cryptography.
### LIST OPTIONS OF AN ALGORITHM
    openssl aes-128-ecb -help

    -salt              Use a salt in the key derivation routines (default)
    -v                 Verbose

### ENCRYPT A FILE
We are going to encrypt a file (image.jpg), with a key, generated from a passphrase (a password selected by the user, which will be converted to a 128-bit secret key, using an algorithm called [PBKDF2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2)):

    openssl aes-128-ecb -in ./imagem.jpg -out ./imagem.aes.jpg -e -a -k secretpass -pbkdf2

### DECRYPT A FILE
Let's now decrypt a file (image.aes.jpg) and recover the original format (image.orig.jpg).

    openssl aes-128-ecb -in ./imagem.aes.jpg -out ./imagem.orig.jpg -d -a -k secretpass -pbkdf2

### CIPHERING AND DECIPHERING AN IMAGE
It is intended that in this activity you can use symmetric key cryptography to encrypt an image using different modes of operation (ECB and CBC). In order to perform this activity you will have to get an uncompressed image (using for example Windows Bitmap (.bmp) format), in which you will have to separate the header from the image data (body).
You can choose any image on the Web or you can create your own. Don't forget that it has to be of the BMP type. It is preferable to use an image with high color contrast, for a better visual effect.

As a note to help you with this task, in order to separate the header from the image data (body), you can use the following commands:

    head -c 54 IMAGEM.bmp > header
    tail -c +55 IMAGEM.bmp > body

We will generate a random key to be able to encrypt the image:

    openssl rand -hex 32

We will encrypt the image using ECB mode (we use the random key obtained in the previous step):

    openssl aes-256-ecb -e -in ./body -out ./body_ecb -K 2ffd27e0675b9bd6c34e37109c4ebef378f356f0fa7eeeaf11eb2433e21e980e

After you have encrypted the image data (body), you can re-attach the header to get the image in the full format:

    cat header body_ecb > imagem_ECB.bmp

We are going to cipher the image now with CBC mode. For this mode we need to use an IV. To create this IV we can generate it randomly:

    openssl rand -hex 16

We will encrypt the image using CBC mode (we use the random key obtained in the previous step and the IV):

    openssl aes-256-cbc -e -in ./body -out ./body_cbc -K 2ffd27e0675b9bd6c34e37109c4ebef378f356f0fa7eeeaf11eb2433e21e980e -iv 0faf3e077df51ebd98cd11925ad9dcd1

After you have encrypted the image data (body), you can re-attach the header to get the image in the full format:

    cat header body_cbc > imagem_CBC.bmp

## HASH GENERATION
OpenSSL also has features for generating hashes of various types.
### GENERATE HASH OF A FILE
Using SHA1

    openssl sha1 ./imagem.jpg 

    SHA1(./imagem.jpg)= 95e91837dc1a4a8eeb42208420d8620cb8d7785f

Using SHA256
    openssl sha256 ./imagem.jpg 

    SHA256(./imagem.jpg)= b110ed205353743923c7d66811a2916e2cc3bb3a06e7411e79a4b124ca1322d0

Using RIPEMD160
    openssl ripemd160 ./imagem.jpg 

    RIPEMD160(./imagem.jpg)= f9bb6ff349a5f03531af89774f9a6578a785aec8

### GENERATE A MESSAGE AUTHENTICATION CODE
In order to generate a hash-based message authentication code, we need to provide the hash algorithm to be used and the secret key to encrypt the hash.

    openssl sha1 -hmac 24899ec1e452d219121f0d07cd6975b7 ./imagem.jpg

    HMAC-SHA1(./imagem.jpg)= 384773867cb7bce6ffd97a95c26e65666c045ea7

## ASYMMETRIC CRYPTOGRAPHY
OpenSSL also allows you to implement a series of asymmetric cryptographic features-key pair generation, encryption of decryption of information with OpenSSL.
### KEY PAIR GENERATION
You can see which parameters the key generation uses:

    openssl genrsa -help

    usage: genrsa [args] [numbits]
    -des            encrypt the generated key with DES in cbc mode
    -des3           encrypt the generated key with DES in ede cbc mode (168 bit key)
    -idea           encrypt the generated key with IDEA in cbc mode
    -seed
                    encrypt PEM output with cbc seed
    -aes128, -aes192, -aes256
                    encrypt PEM output with cbc aes
    -camellia128, -camellia192, -camellia256
                    encrypt PEM output with cbc camellia
    -out file       output the key to 'file
    -passout arg    output file pass phrase source
    -f4             use F4 (0x10001) for the E value
    -3              use 3 for the E value
    -engine e       use engine e, possibly a hardware device.
    -rand file:file:...
                    load the file (or the files in the directory) into
                    the random number generator

### Generate a key pair
Let's generate a key pair with 4096 bits of dimension.

    openssl genrsa -out ./keypair.pem 4096

    Generating RSA private key, 4096 bit long modulus
    ........................................................................................................................................................................++
    ..........................++
    e is 65537 (0x10001)

The generated key is stored in [PKCS#1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS) format, with the following structure ([ASN.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASN.1)):

    RSAPrivateKey ::= SEQUENCE {
        version           Version,
        modulus           INTEGER,  -- n
        publicExponent    INTEGER,  -- e
        privateExponent   INTEGER,  -- d
        prime1            INTEGER,  -- p
        prime2            INTEGER,  -- q
        exponent1         INTEGER,  -- d mod (p-1)
        exponent2         INTEGER,  -- d mod (q-1)
        coefficient       INTEGER,  -- (inverse of q) mod p
        otherPrimeInfos   OtherPrimeInfos OPTIONAL
    }

To view it, we can do:

    openssl rsa -in keypair.pem -text

### Generate a key pair and protect the private key
We are going to create a keypair and protect the private key with a password (PKCS#5).

    openssl genrsa -out ./keypair.pem -aes128 4096

    Generating RSA private key, 4096 bit long modulus
    ...................................................................................++
    .......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................++
    e is 65537 (0x10001)
    Enter pass phrase for ./keypair.pem:

When generating the key pair, both keys are stored in the same file, so if you want to extract the public key, you have to do it explicitly.

    openssl rsa -in keypair.pem -pubout -out ./publickey.pem

### ENCRYPT USING THE PUBLIC KEY
It is only suitable for encrypting small blocks of information. In this case a "`secretkey`" file was created, with a small random value using the command "`openssl rand -out ./secretkey 32`". Then this file was encrypted using the public key.

    openssl pkeyutl -encrypt -inkey -pubin ./publickey.pem -in ./secretkey -out ./secretkey.enc

### DECRYPT USING THE PRIVATE KEY
With the following command it is possible to get the original text back by decrypting it with the corresponding private key.

    openssl pkeyutl -decrypt -inkey ./keypair.pem -in ./secretkey.enc -out ./secretkey.dec
